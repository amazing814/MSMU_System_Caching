This is the script for my master thesis, which tries to apply the Fundamental Limist of Caching scheme into
more complex network structures, i.e., multi-sender multi-user system with complicated network structures.

A new concept as "capable sender" is proposed in this thesis, which enabled the cooperation among senders.

Based on capable sender concept,  two different methods are also proposed to split the delivery tasks among the senders as equally as possible.

Maximum matching algorithm is used in the second method.
